# Project title

Auto Encryption and Decryption

## Getting Started

By draging a file into the ToEncrypt folder, your file will automatically get encrypted and vice versa.


### Prerequisites

You just need to clone the git repository onto your computer or download it's zip file and extract it.


### Installing

You just need to execute the file install.sh into your terminal and the job is done with the code : ./install.sh

note:*Sometimes you need to give the file executable rights for it to be able to install on your pc, the code to fix that is :chmod +x install.sh*

The code will copy itself into your home ~/src to avoid conflits and issues.
You are then free to delete the folder you have downloaded.
